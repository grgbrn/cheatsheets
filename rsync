# To copy files from remote to local, maintaining file properties and sym-links
# (-a), zipping for faster transfer (-z), verbose (-v):
rsync -avz host:file1 :file1 /dest/
rsync -avz /source host:/dest

# To copy files using checksum (-c) rather than time to detect if the file has
# changed. (Useful for validating backups):
rsync -avc <src> <dest>

# To copy contents of /src/foo to destination:
# This command will create /dest/foo if it does not already exist
rsync -auv <src> <dest>

# To explicitly copy <src> to <dest>
rsync -auv <src> <dest>

# To copy file from local to remote over ssh with non standard port 1234 to
# destination folder in remoteuser's home directory:
rsync -avz -e "ssh -p1234" <source> <username>@<host>:<dest>

|||||||||||
||||||||||╰- x: The extended attribute information changed
|||||||||╰-- a: The ACL information changed
||||||||╰--- u: The u slot is reserved for future use
|||||||╰---- g: Group is different
||||||╰----- o: Owner is different
|||||╰------ p: Permission are different
||||╰------- t: Modification time is different
|||╰-------- s: Size is different
||╰--------- c: Different checksum (for regular files), or

|╰---------- the file type:
|            f: for a file,
|            d: for a directory,
|            L: for a symlink,
|            D: for a device,
|            S: for a special file (e.g. named sockets and fifos)
╰----------- the type of update being done::
             <: file is being transferred to the remote host (sent)
             >: file is being transferred to the local host (received)
             c: local change/creation for the item, such as:
                - the creation of a directory
                - the changing of a symlink,
                - etc.
             h: the item is a hard link to another item (requires 
                --hard-links).
             .: the item is not being updated (though it might have
                attributes that are being modified)
             *: means that the rest of the itemized-output area contains
                a message (e.g. "deleting")
